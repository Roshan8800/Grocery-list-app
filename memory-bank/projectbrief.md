# Project Brief: Listonic

## 1. Project Goal & North Star

The primary goal of the Listonic project is to build a sleek, modern, and futuristic mobile application for managing lists. The "North Star" is to create a visually engaging and highly usable list-making experience with a dark-mode-first, neon-infused aesthetic.

## 2. Scope

The current scope of the project is to build the foundational UI of the application based on a series of design briefs provided by the user. This includes:
- A dark, futuristic theme.
- A specific color scheme with glowing elements.
- A modern typography system.
- Custom button and card styling.
- A responsive, mobile-first layout.

The initial version of the app is a simple counter app, which serves as a canvas for implementing and iterating on the UI design.

## 3. High-Level Requirements

- **Functional:**
  - The app must be a valid Flutter application that can be built and run on web, Android, and iOS.
  - The app should have a functional counter to demonstrate UI interactivity.
- **Non-Functional:**
  - The UI must adhere to the specified "sleek, modern, and futuristic" theme.
  - The code must be well-organized and maintainable.
  - The project should be easy for other developers (both human and AI) to pick up and contribute to.

## 4. Business Objectives

While not explicitly stated, the business objective can be inferred as creating a visually appealing and user-friendly application that can serve as a foundation for a more feature-rich list management tool in the future. The focus on a strong visual identity suggests a goal of differentiating the app in a crowded market.
