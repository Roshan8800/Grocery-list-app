# Active Context: Listonic

## 1. Current Priorities

- The current priority is to establish a comprehensive "memory-bank" system to document the project's context, design, and progress.
- After the memory-bank is established, the next priority is to await further instructions from the user regarding new features or changes.

## 2. Recent Changes

- Implemented a "memory-bank" system with six core Markdown files.
- Updated the `README.md` with detailed setup instructions.
- Implemented a new typography theme using "Exo 2" for headings and "Nunito" for body text.
- Implemented a new button theme with a neon blue fill for primary actions.
- Implemented a new card theme with rounded corners and a glowing effect.
- Refactored the UI to use the new theme elements.

## 3. Next Steps

- Await user feedback and instructions for the next feature or design iteration.
- Continue to maintain and update the memory-bank as the project evolves.

## 4. Active Decisions & Implementation Focus

- The current focus is on documentation and context-setting.
- All new UI development should adhere to the established theme and design principles.
- The project is being developed with a mobile-first approach, but web compatibility is being maintained for verification purposes.

## 5. Lessons Learned

- The Flutter build system can be sensitive to type mismatches between `Theme` and `ThemeData` objects, especially when refactoring theme data into separate files. Careful attention to the specific types required by the `ThemeData` constructor is crucial.
- When working in a sandboxed environment, it's important to be mindful of file system limitations and the persistence of the current working directory across commands.
