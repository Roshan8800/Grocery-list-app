# Listonic

A sleek, modern, and futuristic mobile app for managing your lists.

## Theme

The app uses a dark-mode-first approach with a focus on vibrant, glowing elements against a dark backdrop, creating a high-contrast and visually engaging experience.

- **Color Scheme:** Deep, dark black background, accented with a dynamic and energetic gradient of neon pink and vibrant purple. A secondary accent color of bright, electric blue is used for primary call-to-action elements.
- **Typography:** "Exo 2" for headings and "Nunito" for body text, providing a futuristic yet readable feel.
- **Buttons:** Pill-shaped with a solid neon blue fill for primary actions.
- **Cards:** Rounded corners with a floating effect and a soft, diffused glow.
